## What is Inclusive Language?

Inclusive language is [defined](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/inclusive-language) as "language that avoids the use of certain expressions or words that might be considered to exclude particular groups of people." 

When using inclusive language, [you are](https://communications.uoregon.edu/inclusive-language) "acknowledging diversity, conveying respect to all people, being sensitive to differences, and promoting equitable opportunities."

### What does Inclusive Language Mean at Pantheon? 

It is how we show up. At Pantheon, everyone has a responsibility to communicate and behave inclusively. It's the way we lift others up, show up for others, speak up in meetings, and consistently consider other perspectives and backgrounds. 

We know inclusive language is essential in [building trust](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/04/03/why-inclusive-language-matters-in-tech/#336a80c96017), to [attracting talent](https://medium.com/diversity-together/70-inclusive-language-principles-that-will-make-you-a-more-successful-recruiter-part-1-79b7342a0923), and [aiding productivity](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity). But most importantly, it will help us grow a diverse company where inclusivity is the very fabric of how we act, speak, feel, and think.

### What is racial language? 

Racial language is derogatory to people due to their ethnicity, race, or skin color. These terms, slurs, and stereotypes contributed to decades of prejudice, discrimination, and violence.

#### Examples & Alternatives:

At Pantheon, we have standardized on: 
* `Allowlist`/`blocklist` rather than `whitelist`/`blacklist`
* `main` rather than `master` for branch naming conventions

Engineering work is ongoing to correct these naming conventions.
